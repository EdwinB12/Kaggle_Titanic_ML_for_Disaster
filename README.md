# Kaggle: Titanic ML for Disaster

The goal of this project is to predict who would survive onboard the famous Titanic disaster. This project is a popular Kaggle competition called 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster'. https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic 

I used this project to practice my data handling skills in Python, aswell as gaining experience using the Scikit-Learn for a binary classification problem. 



## Introduction to the challenge

The aim of this project is to use machine learning techniques to predict whether a person would have survived or not survived the titanic disaster. 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew onboard the Titanic died. A training dataset is provided including whether each person survived. A Test dataset is also provided but without any indication of survival. The final score is determined by what percentage are correctly predicted to have survived. 

### Data

Two datasets are provided: 
- Training dataset: 891 passengers information provided
- Test dataset: 418 passengers information provided

## My Approach 

I split the project into two phases: 
- Data Prep
  - Feature Engineering 
  - Data Cleaning
  - Data Preparation 
  
- Training and Evaluation 

### Data Prep 

I prepped the data in two different ways. 
- Prep 1 : Submission 1-5
- Prep 2 : Submissions 6-10

#### Prep 1
This was a very simple approach to preparing the data, designed to create a benchmark value.  
The feature engineering simply involved either accepting or rejecting a provided feature. Simple linear relationships were assessed between each feature
